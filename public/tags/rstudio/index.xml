      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;create-a-working-directory&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Create a working directory&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually, people want to keep the folder structure on their computers tidy, so that they and their co-workers understand, which documents and data were used for a particular project â€“ even if that project was finished months ago. This should also be the case when you work with R. Therefore, I recommend to create a new folder for every new project, which becomes the so-called working directory. There you put all the files, which are necessary for a project. For example, for this introduction I created the folder &lt;em&gt;r_intro&lt;/em&gt; in my file explorer and I recommend to do the same on your computer now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this introduction I recommend to install two software packages on your system:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;: The software, which does all the calculations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;RStudio&lt;/em&gt;: The working environment, where all the code will be developed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that the instructions of this section were written for a standard installation on a private computer. If you work on a corporate machine, the installation could be different due to different IT requirements of your company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;installing-r&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installing R&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A proper installation of R is the prerequisite of everything that will follow. Fortunately, installing R is easy and can be done quickly by following these steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
