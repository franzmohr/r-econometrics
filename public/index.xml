      <title>An Introduction to Stationarity and Unit Roots in Time Series Analysis</title>

      <description>Concepts Basically stationarity means that a time series has a constant mean and constant variance over time. Althouth not particularly imporant for the estimation of parameters of econometric models these features are essential for the calculation of reliable test statistics and, hence, can have a significant impact on model selection.
To illustrate this concept, let’s look at quarterly data on disposable income in billion DM from 1960 to 1982, which is data set E1 from Luetkepohl (2007).</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Impulse Response Analysis of VAR Models</title>
      <link>https://www.r-econometrics.com/timeseries/irf/</link>

      <description>Impulse response analysis is an important step in econometric analyes, which employ vector autoregressive models. Their main purpose is to describe the evolution of a model’s variables in reaction to a shock in one or more variables. This feature allows to trace the transmission of a single shock within an otherwise noisy system of equations and, thus, makes them very useful tools in the assessment of economic policies. This post provides an introduction to the concept and interpretation of impulse response functions as they are commonly used in the VAR literature and provides code for their calculation in R.</description>

      <description>With the increasing availability of granular data on the relationships between individual entities - such as persons (social media), countries (internatinal trade) and financial institutions (supervisory reporting) - network analysis offers many possibilities to extract useful information from such data. This post provides an introduction to network analysis in R using the powerful igraph package for the calculation of metrics and ggraph for visualisation. It marks the beginning of a more comprehensive treatment of network analysis on r-econometrics.</description>

      <description>There are multiple packages for the analysis of networks in R. This page concentrates on the igraph package, which allows for a broad range of applications. But before we get into it in more detail, it is useful to know that there are two possible ways to represent the edges, i.e. the connections, of a network:
 Adjacency matrix: This is a square matrix, where each row and column corresponds to an entity.</description>

      <description>If a network is small, it can be easily summarised by its graph or a figure. But once a network reaches a certain size, it becomes more meaningful to use more formal summary statistics in order to describe its features. This post covers some basic network summary statistics as presented in Jackson (2008). The metrics are based on the concept of centrality, which describes the importance of a node in a given network of nodes.</description>

      <title>Network Visualisation in R</title>

      <description>Beside the calculation of summarising network metrics, the visualisation of a graph can also be a very informative step in network analysis. Since visualisations in R usually involve the ggplot2 package, I focus on the ggraph package, which is based on the ggplot2 architecture. For illustration I use the artificial data set from my post on network analysis, which is an igraph object names graph_df.
When using ggplot2 the main challenge in the visualisation of networks is to find suitable x- and y-coordinates for the nodes of a graph.</description>

      <description>Model testing belongs to the main tasks of any econometric analysis. This post gives an overview of tests, which should be applied to OLS regressions, and illustrates how to calculate them in R. The focus of the post is rather on the calcuation of the tests. For a treatment of mathematical details, please, consult a standard textbook. This list of statistical tests is necessarily incomplete. However, if you have a strong opinion that a specific test is missing, feel free to leave a comment below.</description>

      <description>The cleaning and transformation of data belong to the most time consuming parts of any economic analysis. Many graphical or statistical functions in R require specifically formated data to work properly. Although the standard functions of R can be used to prepare your data for further analysis, some people find them a bit labourious for daily applications. Therefore, alternatives have been developed, which make data transformation in R easier and also faster.</description>

      <description>Getting help An important part of any R package is its documentation. The documentation of any function can be obtained by using ? followed by the name of the function or by using help(&amp;quot;function_name&amp;quot;). After the execution of a help command a new page should appear in the lower right window in RStudio. If not, click on the tab Help in the lower right window. The help page contains the title of the function followed by a short description.</description>

      <description>Create a working directory Usually, people want to keep the folder structure on their computers tidy, so that they and their co-workers understand, which documents and data were used for a particular project – even if that project was finished months ago. This should also be the case when you work with R. Therefore, I recommend to create a new folder for every new project, which becomes the so-called working directory.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Vector Error Correction Models (VECMs)</title>

      <description>One of the prerequisits for the estimation of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is that the analysed time series are stationary. However, economic theory suggests that there exist equilibrium relations between economic variables in their levels, which can render these variables stationary without taking differences. This is called cointegration. Since knowing the size of such relationships can improve the results of an analysis, it would be desireable to have an econometric model, which is able to capture them.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian methods have significantly gained in popularity during the last decades as computers have become more powerful and new software has been developed. Their flexibility and other advantageous features have made these methods also more popular in econometrics. This post gives a brief introduction to Bayesian VAR (BVAR) models and provides the code to set up and estimate a basic model with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=bvartools&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bvartools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Introduction This post provides the code to set up and estimate a basic Bayesian vector error correction (BVEC) model with the bvartools package. The presented Gibbs sampler is based on the approach of Koop et al. (2010), who propose a prior on the cointegration space.
 Data To illustrate the estimation process, the dataset E6 from Lütkepohl (2007) is used, which contains data on German long-term interest rates and inflation from 1972Q2 to 1998Q4.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Search Variable Selection</title>

      <guid>https://www.r-econometrics.com/timeseries/ssvs/</guid>
      <description>Introduction A general drawback of vector autoregressive (VAR) models is that the number of estimated coefficients increases disproportionately with the number of lags. Therefore, fewer information per parameter is available for the estimation as the number of lags increases. In the Bayesian VAR literature one approach to mitigate this so-called curse of dimensionality is stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) as proposed by George et al. (2008). The basic idea of SSVS is to assign commonly used prior variances to parameters, which should be included in a model, and prior variances close to zero to irrelevant parameters.</description>

This post reproduces Timmer et al. (2015), who introduce the world input-output database (WIOD) and present basic concepts of GVC analysis.
Data Timmer et al. (2015) use the 2013 vintage of the world input-output database (WIOD). The following code downloads the data from the project’s website, unzips it and loads the resulting STATA file into R using the readstata13 package.</description>

      <description>The analysis of economic time series often requires the extraction of their cyclical components. This post presents some methods, which can be used to decompose time series into their different components. It is based on the chapter on business cycles by Stock and Watson (1999) in the Handbook of Macroeconomics, but also presents some more recent methods like Hamilton’s (2018) alternative to the HP-filter, wavelet filtering and empirical mode decomposition.</description>

      <description>Although heteroskedasticity does not produce biased OLS estimates, it leads to a bias in the variance-covariance matrix. This means that standard model testing methods such as t tests or F tests cannot be relied on any longer. This post provides an intuitive illustration of heteroskedasticity and covers the calculation of standard errors that are robust to it.
Data A popular illustration of heteroskedasticity is the relationship between saving and income, which is shown in the following graph.</description>

      <description>This section is intended to get you through your undergraduate (and maybe graduate) studies in econometrics. It is based on examples from Wooldridge, J.M. (2013). Introductory econometrics: A modern approach (5thed.). I have also reproduced the examples of the main text, which you can find in the reproduction section of the site. Alternatively, Heiss, F. (2016) Using R for Introductory Econometrics is a standalone textbook, which covers the same topics as Wooldridge (2013) and provides an introduction to R as well.</description>

      <description>Formulated at the beginning of the 19th century by Legendre and Gauss the method of least squares is a standard tool in econometrics to assess the relationships between different variables. This site gives a short introduction to the basic idea behind the method and describes how to estimate simple linear models with OLS in R.
The method of least squares To understand the basic idea of the method of least squares, imagine you were an astronomer at the beginning of the 19th century, who faced the challenge of combining a series of observations, which were made with imperfect instruments and at different points in time.</description>

      <description>In R the function for basic linear regression models is lm, which is short for linear model. Its first argument is a formula of the regression model, which has the form y ~ a. The tilde between y and a indicates that y is the dependent variable and a is the explanatory variable. It is also possible to add a further explanatory variable - for example b - to the regression by adding a plus sign followed by the the name of the additional variable to the formula.</description>

      <description>Since the seminal paper of Sims (1980) vector autoregressive models have become a key instrument in macroeconomic research. This post presents the basic concept of VAR analysis and guides through the estimation procedure of a simple model. When I started my undergraduate program in economics I occasionally encountered the abbreviation VAR in some macro papers. I was fascinated by those waves in the boxes titled impulse responses and wondered how difficult it would be to do such reseach on my own.</description>

      <description>R can be comprehended as a language that provides the basis for a system of code chunks, which have been developed by many people across the globe, who wanted to share their work. These code chunks are called packages. And each of those packages usually consist of at least one function.1 This structure is presented in the following graph. Beside a schematic description of a package and its functions in the upper part of the graph it also contains some real world examples using the packages ggplot2 and dplyr.</description>

      <description>library(wooldridge) In order to estimate panel data models, I use the plm function from the plm package. The intuition behind its structure is similar to the ordinary linear model, except that it allows you to specify the panel’s group and time variables and the effects model.
Example 14.1 Similar to the lm function, you can specify your model’s equation and the sample. Since you want to use panel data methods for you estimation, you also have to specify which variables in your sample contain the information used to distinguish different groups and which variable contains the time measurement.</description>

      <description>Below you find the script for all examples in chapter 3 of Wooldridge (2013). The only difference to the last chapter is how to use multiple independent variables in the lm function. This is easily achieved by separating each exogenous variable that should enter the model with a plus sign, e.g. lm(colGPA ~ hsGPA + ACT).
The other commands that appear new are quite helpful and you should take a minute to think about them:</description>

      <description>Chapter 6 in Wooldridge (2013) deals with some more issues that might have an impact on your estimates. Among these are a change in the scale of your variables, so-called beta-factors and the interpretation of variables that appear together with their squared values, i.e. interaction terms.

      <description>A major challenge in data analysis is to summarise and present data with informative graphs. The ggplot2 package was specifically designed to help with this task. Since it is a very powerful and well documented package1, this introduction will only focus on its basic syntax, so that the user gets a better understanding of how to read the supporting material on the internet.
ggplot graphs are built with some kind of blocks, which usually start with the function ggplot.</description>

      <description>For this introduction I recommend to install two software packages on your system:
 R: The software, which does all the calculations. RStudio: The working environment, where all the code will developed.  Note that the instructions of this section were written for a standard installation on a private computer. If you work on a corporate machine, the installation could be different due to different IT requirements of your company.</description>

      <description>Before we start, let’s clear our memory, set the working directory and load the wooldridge data package.
rm(list = ls()) setwd(&amp;quot;C:/path/to/the/working/directory&amp;quot;) library(wooldridge) data(wage1) lm.1 &amp;lt;- lm(lwage ~ educ + exper + tenure, data = wage1) s.1 &amp;lt;- summary(lm.1) s.1 ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = lwage ~ educ + exper + tenure, data = wage1) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.05802 -0.29645 -0.03265 0.28788 1.</description>
